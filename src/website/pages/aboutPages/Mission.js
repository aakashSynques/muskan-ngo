                            <p>The areas of work that we would be focusing on are primarily - </p>

                            <p><strong>1. Education Implementation at the Ground Level –</strong> We have been
                                continuously striving for providing quality and relevant education
                                of children of marginalized communities. Through our approach
                                which has taken into account the needs of the children and their
                                communities, we have been successful in making this a reality
                                through a package of interventions and adapting ourselves.</p>
                            <p>We would continue this work, even though it is challenging in
                                terms of financial (as school education is not supported easily by
                                private donors, more so in an urban set-up) and team capacities
                                (as it requires a lot of personal touch).</p>
                            <p>We hope through this work, to take more young people of very
                                vulnerable communities towards completion of schooling and
                                thereby access institutes of quality higher education, even if it is
                                a few in different geographical clusters, but a focus being on
                                girls and boys and vulnerable communities.</p>

                            <p className='m-0'>Some of the things we would be doing in a phased manner –</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Run our current school and hostel.</li>
                                <li>Facilitate youth who have dropped out/are studying in Class 9
                                    or so in their education journeys.</li>
                                <li>Fellowships and Scholarships to youth to be able to study.</li>
                                <li>English coaching for young people of vulnerable
                                    communities.</li>

                                <li>Facilitate the set up of a school and hostel complex over an
                                    area of about 10 acres which is run through an adivasi
                                    leadership emergent from our people and networks.</li>
                                <li>Enhance children’s expression and secular values through
                                    outreach programs in the form of libraries and centres in

                            <p><strong>2. Advocacy around Tribal Education –</strong> The issues of tribal
                                education need to be seen within the ambits of education rights as much as tribal rights. The values of indigenous ways of living
                                need to guide the present world. <br />
                                Multilingual pedagogy has been seen only as a means to access
                                the mainstream target languages, but our pedagogy has built on
                                seeing your mother-tongue as a resource to learn other target
                                languages (inspired by the work of Ramakant Agnihotri and
                                others) and in the belief that expression and identity is
                                strengthened the most in your own mother-tongue (as held by
                                Ngugi Wa Thing’O and tribal activists in Brazil and others). A
                                curriculum around tribal education would be premised on an
                                understanding of colonization, history, trauma, subaltern
                                literature, nature, science, struggles and more.
                            </p>
                            <p>We see our work in this direction growing in the form of -</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Documentation of classroom practices, and Publications
                                    around various aspects of Multilingual Pedagogy and Tribal
                                    Education.</li>
                                <li>Building / contributing to existing networks which take
                                    forward the issues of tribal education, multilingual pedagogy.</li>
                                <li>Trainings for teachers, new groups and organizations that
                                    want to do this kind of work.</li>
                                <li>Seminars on these themes to build an awareness and
                                    energy around this cause.</li>
                                <li>Course Design for Universities providing degrees in
                                    Education and advocacy for incorporation of this.</li>

                            <p><strong>3. Children’s Literature –</strong> In the past decade, as we saw that there
                                is very little of children&#39;s literature representing the marginalized
                                community in our country, we began our foray in this area as we
                                believe that stories affirm the reader’s identity and also enable
                                understanding others, thus functioning as mirrors and glasses. <br />
                                Stories we have published depict the lives and culture of the
                                communities we work with, and are primarily been written/told by
                                community members and our students. We also did a seminar in
                                2019 to discuss the nitty-gritty of publishing and representing
                                voices from the margins. We (would like to) believe this meet
                                has pushed some big publishers to think about this more
                                seriously.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the coming years, we would like to adopt the following strategies -</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Building skills with more groups/organizations, for building
                                    literature from the ground and from varied geographies.</li>
                                <li>Building a team of people who work with young people from
                                    the margins in enhancing their expression and writing. This
                                    would need to be from elementary classes to senior classes.
                                    This could also be in the form of documenting oral literature.</li>
                                <li>Hold discussions and meets with various stakeholders
                                    around subaltern literature for children, for creating a space
                                    for this need.</li>
                                <li>Promoting library spaces as venues for conversations
                                    around diversity.</li>
                                <li>Facilitating workshops on diversity for librarians and teachers
                                    so that they are able to carry this through in their interactions
                                    with children and young people.</li>
                                <li>It will be our priority to organize regular seminars on these
                                    issues where artists, writers, painters from marginalized
                                    communities will be getting a platform and they will be
                                    putting their thoughts and experiences in front of the world.</li>
                            </ul>


                            <p><strong>4. Field Interventions and Advocacy for Rights of Denotified Tribal
                                Groups –</strong> Our chance engagement with Pardhi children who were
                                waste-picking, has impacted the course of the organization,
                                quite significantly. It has helped us understand the state,
                                marginalization and also the limitations of NGOs and the
                                possible trajectories of communities into the future. <br />We feel we have the experience and attitude that is needed to
                                work with these groups and also realize that this work is critically
                                needed to fill in the gaps of other groups and state interventions,
                                with the hope of changing/contributing to the course of
                                ‘development’ within these groups.</p>

                            <p>Our work in this area should be building with the following
                                approaches -</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Field interventions with communities in and around Bhopal
                                    and in Madhya Pradesh, with a focus on building youth
                                    leadership, incorporating Ultimate Frisbee, theatre, education
                                    and other intervention strategies that are core to Muskaan.</li>
                                <li>Connecting with other groups and individuals working amidst
                                    DNTs and building a common network for sharing and
                                    learning and common efforts.</li>
                                <li>Carry out research on issues pertinent to these communities
                                    and raise these issues at national and international platforms
                                    for getting the attention needed at these non-visible
                                    situations, along with an action research on the interventions
                                    being tried out.</li>
                                <li>Advocacy and Training Juvenile Justice Boards, Child
                                    Welfare Committees for appropriate interventions on lives of
                                    DNTs than seeing them through a blame lens.</li>
                                <li>Networking with Government Departments for improved
                                    coverage of schemes for DNTs.</li>
                                <li>Making issues of children, youth and adults of DNT
                                    communities more visible and continuously in the public
                                    domain to all through publications (reports, journal writings,
                                    research), seminars and continuous raise issues at identified
                                    platforms.</li>
                                <li>For this purpose, a possible museum kind of space where
                                    lives of DNTs could be understood by any and everyone
                                    would be set up.</li>
                                <li>Anchor for human rights violations in these communities
                                    through helpline mechanisms set up in collaboration with
                                    other groups.</li>
                                <li>Building / strengthening the DNT lens in programs of
                                    government, NGOs and donors.</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>5. Support for Community-led groups –</strong> As more community led
                                groups evolve through current efforts, we would be taking a
                                back-step in some community efforts and strengthen the groups
                                / organizations as Majal, Lahar, and more. This would imply
                                primarily trainings and facilitating networking. Fund raising and
                                vision building with these groups is considered part of the
                                training inputs, and we see ourselves not limited to trainings but
                                actually supporting them in this effort where/when needed.
                                Conflict resolution is also a skill and perspective that has to be
                                built into democratic teams. </p>

                            <p><strong>6. Mental Health amidst Indigenous Communities  –</strong>Addictions,
                                Suicides, unnatural deaths of other forms, high rates of drop-
                                outs are part of the lives of denotified tribes and many urban
                                poor populations.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Implementation of art therapies, including movement
                                    therapy, in classrooms and communities.</li>
                                <li>Workshops on parenting, on gender and to understand and
                                    reflect on personal traumas with community members.</li>
                                <li>Building a base of community mental health workers and
                                    curriculum based on practice.</li>
                                <li>Networking with other groups for expansion of learning and
                                    a voice on Mental Health responses in schools and
                                    community settings.</li>
                                <li>Interventions around Violence and Suicide with affected
                                    people</li>
                                <li>Research including Action Research and thereby sharing of
                                    learnings on these issues</li>

                            </ul>


                            <p><strong>7. Child Participation and Child Rights</strong> It is important that we all keep a ear to what children say and feel.
                                We believe our organizational learnings have been driven from
                                this, and since 2015, we were more conscious of the arena of
                                ‘child participation’ in terms of a conscious approach in work.
                                <br />

                                We have strongly raised the issues related to rights of children,
                                may it be about labour, real education, violence, abuse, freedom to
                                marry of their own choice, identity.
                                <br />
                                The collective work with children has ensured that we are able to
                                reach out to working children, who have not been able to take out
                                regular time for studies. Azad Jugnu Club is an established group
                                of children which has done advocacy of children&#39;s issues with the
                                participation of children. Various positive results are visible from
                                this effort. These efforts have also been seen very effective in the
                                personal life of the children.
                                <br />
                                We also believe that children are open to change, and more open
                                to new ideas. Therefore ‘progressive’ work with them is the base of
                                a humane society.
